        <h1>HOW TO FIND SANTA</h1>
        <p>there are many methods</p>

                <p>It's the night before Christmas. The night grows dark and the christmas lights shine bright and colorful. That is when <em>He</em> makes his appearance. Very few have been lucky (or unlucky) enough to see him. These are pieces of knowledge gathered from the many encounters throughout the years.</p>
                <h3>Cameras</h3>
                <p>Cameras are a bit of a double-edged sword. They can be your greatest asset or the weakness that makes an encounter impossible. His intuition is impeccable and he will know unless you hide them well.</p>
                <h3>Timing</h3>
                <p>He has a schedule that he follows to the dot. According to research, he arrives between 9 PM and midnight on Christmas Eve. However, if children are still awake when he arrives, he will move on to the next house. That brings us to the next topic.</p>
                <h3>Children</h3>
                <p>The recipients of the many gifts he has. Should your child receive a gift not accounted for, contact us immediately. Once your child has opened up the present, chances of discovering fingerprints and other evidence diminishes.</p>
                <h3>Sound</h3>
                <p>It's 9 PM. Make sure everyone is asleep. The first sign will be the jingle of the bells. Followed by footsteps on your roof. Witnesses say his footsteps were weak. Barely audible. How a man of his stature can move about so quietly, is a mystery we have not been able to solve, but may be connected to his many abilities. The sound of him passing through the chimney is what is most commonly reported to us.</p>
                <h3>Inside</h3>
                <p>His first course of action will be to scout your room for children who are still awake, cameras that aren't hidden well enough, and most importantly, milk and cookies. A common and reliable stalling tactic. It could be the thing that buys you enough time to get a glimpse of him before he leaves.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>It's a time of many opportunities. This is your best shot at getting a glimpse of the man. Known also as the "Entity" or "Santa Claus". Should you miss it, he will not appear again until next year and it will be increasingly difficult to catch a glimpse, as he will be well aware that you weren't sleeping.</p>

                <p>Another common (although widely regarded to be futile) tactic is to catch a glimpse of him while he's flying from house to house. There have been many attempts made, with no success.</p>
                <h3>Speed</h3>
                <p>The main reason why such a photo is difficult. The logistics of delivering gifts to every child on the planet implies tremendous velocities are reached. Some have claimed to hear sonic booms on Christmas Eve, although they may have mistaken an F-16 Fighter Jet for Santa. It is hypothesized that Santa can slip through the air unnoticed and unaffected, avoiding the buildup of a sonic shock front.</p>
