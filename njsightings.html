          <p>
           "Santa" has appeared troughout our history in multiple instances in various different forms, what he/it actually is, well its hard to say. it might not even be a single thing but multiple. it could be its own species.

        <h2>Mythical</h2>
        <p>
           Some of the different iterations of Santa that have been recorded troughout our time is for example the goat/devil like creature appearing and kindnapping children, this iteration is also know as krampus to some. Another iteration is the mythical loch-ness monster, though we are convinced that this was actually santa and the image has been altered to hide its true identity.
           lastly it is heavily speculated that the eldritch god being Cthulhu himself is actually just santa. we shudder at the thought.

        <h2>Pretenders</h2>
        <p>
           Unfortunately, tracking santa has become increasingly difficult over the years as more and more people irresponsibly dress up as him/it, polluting the instances of his apparance with falsehoods. this makes it harder for us to actually track him/it and eventually confront this being.
